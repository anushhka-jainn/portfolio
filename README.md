I’m a developer with a knack for turning ideas into reality. I thrive on challenges—like building a healthcare app in a hackathon—and enjoy blending creativity with tech. My focus is on web development, and user-friendly design, all aimed at solving real-world problems. Whether it’s simplifying medical reports or connecting people to doctors, I’m driven by impact.

Currently, I’m diving deep into React, exploring AI, and chasing wins at hackathons. When I’m not coding, you might find me brainstorming my next big idea or cheering for my favorite team!
